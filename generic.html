										<h1>MY MOTIVATION</h1>
									</header>


									<p align="justify">Meeting deadlines and targets, for example, are among the many factors that motivate me. I know it sounds strange, but meeting goals is what I'm most excited about. Apart from that, while leading a team of 20 associates at Amazon, I discovered that coaching and assisting people is a huge motivator for me. Another is discovering new things in life and seeing new locations. Other skills include coming up with innovative ideas, enhancing something, creating something new, working as part of a team, building new connections and friends, evaluating complex data, completing a difficult project, solving a problem, overcoming a difficulty, and reaching the desired goal.</p>

									<h1>LEARNINGS AT AMAZON</h1>
									<p align="justify">I started working for Amazon as an SDS Cap Associate in July 2019. In this role, I contributed to raising the bar of customer service by redefining service levels and giving accurate and quick responses to the end-users’ queries and concerns. After April 2020, I was promoted to the capacity of SWAT Associate and guiding the other teams in resolving customer issues and ensuring a high service benchmark. </p>
									<p align="justify">I've been acknowledged for my ability to address difficult problems autonomously and effectively. Until recently, I had a 97 per cent overall happiness rating on Amazon. In a short period of time, I've also progressed to becoming an SME. These roles are a wonderful fit for my skill set. I'm able to find my place in a group and contribute to everyone's efforts. I am a self-motivated individual that is eager to go above and beyond on every project and to self-learn new abilities. In college, for example, I taught myself advanced Microsoft Excel skills and two computer programming languages out of a desire to learn new things.</p>
									<p align="justify">The one and a half year of work experience have revealed to me the greatness and importance of management skills in all domains. The major role of engineers across industries and disciplines is to undertake projects and ensure their completion as per the agreed time, cost, and quality. This cannot be achieved only based on technological know-how; it has to be in tandem with management wisdom. Successful engineering career requires high organisational standards and strong management skills.</p>
									<p align="justify">Here are few photos of my achievements at <strong>Amazon.</strong></p>

									<h1>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</h1>
									<p align="justify">I registered my presence in extra-curricular activities as well by taking part in International Olympiad of Mathematics and Elementary Grade Drawing Examination in school and Slow Biking, Repair-it, Techno Quiz, Maha- Tech, and Science Exhibitions in college. The cherry on the cake was winning several of these contests and adding an extrovert angle to my personality. I also participated in social drives of NGOs like Approach Helping Hands Foundation, Animal Welfare Club, and Hands of Hope Foundation. Executing these philanthropic pursuits not only benefitted the needy but also gave me an immense sense of gratification.</p>
